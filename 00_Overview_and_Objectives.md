# 00\_Overview and Objectives

## Purpose of the Documentation

This documentation provides a structured and comprehensive reference architecture and policy framework for deploying and securing privileged access environments using CyberArk components, in alignment with modern cybersecurity standards and regulatory mandates. It integrates principles of Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA), compliance with international standards (e.g., ISO/IEC 27001, NIST SP 800-53), and best practices such as CIS Benchmarks and Kubernetes hardening guidelines.

The intended audience includes security architects, IT risk officers, compliance professionals, DevOps engineers, and stakeholders responsible for identity and access governance in regulated environments.

## Scope and Coverage

This body of work focuses on the intersection of the following core areas:

* **Privileged Access Management (PAM):**

  * Controls, scope, and implementation standards (CyberArk, NIST, ISO, PCI DSS, DORA)

* **Zero Trust Security Models:**

  * Architecture patterns, enforcement points, identity-aware access, and policy orchestration

* **Compliance and Regulatory Frameworks:**

  * Alignment with GDPR, NIS2, DORA, and their implications for EU financial and service providers

* **Hardening and Technical Baselines:**

  * CIS Benchmarks, NSA Kubernetes Hardening Guidance, configuration security for Linux/Kubernetes

* **CyberArk Platform:**

  * Architecture, components, deployment models, and capabilities

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this documentation series are:

1. **Codify PAM Concepts:**

   * Define privileged access, threat models, architectural boundaries, and operational governance

2. **Map Standards to Implementation:**

   * Bridge the gap between policy frameworks and operational technologies (e.g., CyberArk modules, Kubernetes clusters)

3. **Support Auditable Compliance:**

   * Provide evidence-based mappings to NIST SP 800-53, ISO/IEC 27002, PCI DSS v4.0, DORA, and NIS2 requirements

4. **Operationalize Zero Trust:**

   * Apply ZTA principles to Kubernetes environments, with focus on segmentation, identity enforcement, and workload isolation

5. **Define Secure Integration Models:**

   * Describe proven patterns for deploying CyberArk in hybrid and segmented environments (e.g., DMZ-to-core trust zones)

6. **Establish Technical Baselines:**

   * Leverage CIS and NSA guidance to establish hardening criteria for operating systems and orchestration layers

7. **Enable Repeatability and Governance:**

   * Deliver checklists, deployment guides, and integration recipes suitable for internal policy validation and audits

## Format and Structure

The content is organized into logically grouped Markdown files, each addressing a distinct theme:

1. Regulatory and Standards Context
2. PAM Fundamentals and CyberArk Architecture
3. Kubernetes and DMZ Security Patterns
4. CIS Benchmarks and Hardening Practices
5. Compliance Mapping and Checklists

Each file contains referenced material, factual mappings, and standardized terminology, aligned with security architecture and audit principles.
